# Space Tracker App

This is the space tracker app for my Advanced Server-side Languages class (WDV442).

# 07/18 - update
All CRUD operations have been successfully done and pdf has been created for project. Figured out the StarsPlants was not meant to actually create the items as I looked over the lecture videos in Part 3. I configured the model to hold the proper ID but still didnt have it working properly and do not want to mess with it more as I'm scared of messing up a migration by undoing and redoing them. Anything related to the StarsPlanets has been commented out to not cause errors. Because I created it before I knew what was needed there are two attributes that are not needed which I did not remove again for fear of messing up any other code or migration.

Have all CRUD and Association working but cannot get the new model to form for StarsPlants.. not sure what the issue is that will not let me post. At first it was most likely because it had not routes of its own since they were not provided in the inital set up. All were created following what the others looked like but now it simply does not recognize the .create in the controller section. 

Will now focus on adding the description attribute that is missing and creating more elements for each category.
