# Space Tracker App

This is the space tracker app for my Advanced Server-side Languages class (WDV442).

# 07/18 - update
Have all CRUD and Association working but cannot get the new model to form for StarsPlants.. not sure what the issue is that will not let me post. At first it was most likely because it had not routes of its own since they were not provided in the inital set up. All were created following what the others looked like but now it simply does not recognize the .create in the controller section. 

Will now focus on adding the description attribute that is missing and creating more elements for each category. 

# 07/18 
Have all CRUD asspects working !
Currently trying to make corrections to the sociation betwen stars and planets. 

# 07/17
Have successfully created the files and code needed to create the elements for the tracker.

Now will begin working on the connections between the groups!
